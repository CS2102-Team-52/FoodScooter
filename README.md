* A food delivery system.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

We recommend using an IDE like Intellij for running the program, but it is not a necessity. The following steps take place in the home folder of the project.
1. Run the command `./gradlew build`
2. Run the command `./gradlew bootRun`
3. Run the command `ng serve`

Commands 1 and 2 sets up the backend system. Command 3 sets up the frontend system.
